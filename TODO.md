# TODO

## C++

1. Replace `uint8_t` with `std::size_t` or template argument wherever appropriate
2. Group algorithms into header (".h") and implementation (".cpp") files with same structure as Rust code
3. Find out why 2. causes issues with CMake
4. Group data structures and algorithms tests into same executable to make testing easier
