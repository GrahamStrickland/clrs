% Exercise 2.3-6

Since the loop invariant of \textsc{Insertion-Sort} guarantees that we have
$A[1 \ltwodots j - 1]$ sorted, we can use the \textsc{Binary-Search} algorithm
of 2.3-5 in place of the \textbf{while} loop of lines 5-7.

Since every other operation in the algorithm for \textsc{Insertion-Sort} is
$\Theta(n)$ and the \textbf{while} loop is nested but also $\Theta(n)$, we can
improve the overall worst-case running time to $\Theta(n\lg{n})$,
which is better
than $\Theta(n^2)$ for the original \textsc{Insertion-Sort} algorithm.
