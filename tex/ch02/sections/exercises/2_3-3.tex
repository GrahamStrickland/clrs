% Exercise 2.3-3

\begin{proof}
  We have the base case for $n = 2^1$ given by
  \[
    T(n) = T(2) = 2 = 2\log_2{2^1} = 2 \cdot 1.
  \]
  Now, we assume as our induction step that if $n = 2^k$ for $k > 1$,
  \[
    T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n = n\lg{n}.
  \]
  Then, suppose that $n = 2^{k+1}$, so that we have
  \begin{align*}
    T(n) &= 2T(2^{k+1}/2) + 2^{k+1} &\, \\
    &= 2T(2^k) + 2^{k+1} &\, \\
    &= 2(2^k\lg{2^k}) + 2^{k+1} \qquad
    &\text{(by our induction assumption)} \\
    &= 2^{k+1}\lg{2^k} + 2^{k+1}\lg{2} \qquad
    &\text{(since $\log_2{2} = 1$)} \\
    &= 2^{k+1}\lg{2^{k+1}} \qquad
    &\text{(since $\log_2{a} + \log_2{b} = \log_2{ab}$)}
  \end{align*}
  Therefore, by induction on $n = 2^k$, $T(n) = n\lg{n}$.
\end{proof}
