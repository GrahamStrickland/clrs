% Exercise 2.3-4

We let $T(n)$ be the running time of a problem of size $n$. For $n
\leq 2$, we have
$T(n) = \Theta(2) = \Theta(1)$, since this is just the process of
inserting an item
in either position 1 or 2, so a worst-case time is $\Theta(1)$.

If $n > 2$, our division of the problem yields $n - 1$ subproblems,
each of which is
$\frac{n - 1}{n}$ times the size of the original. It takes
$T(\frac{n(n-1)}{n}) = T(n-1)$
to solve one subproblem, so it takes $(n-1)T(n-1)$ to solve $n - 1$
of them. It then
takes $\Theta(n)$ time to divide the problem into subproblems and
insert the last item
in the array into $A[1\ltwodots n-1]$, so we have
\[
  T(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    \Theta(1) \quad &\text{if } n \leq 2 \\
    (n-1)T(n-1) + \Theta(1) \quad &\text{otherwise} \\
  \end{cases}.
\]
