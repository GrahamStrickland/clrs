% Exercise 2.3-4
 
 We let $T(n)$ be the running time of a problem of size $n$. For $n \leq 2$, we have
 $T(n) = \Theta(2) = \Theta(1)$, since this is just the process of inserting an item 
 in either position 1 or 2, so a worst-case time is $\Theta(1)$.

 If $n > 2$, our division of the problem yields $n - 1$ subproblems, each of which is
 $\frac{n - 1}{n}$ times the size of the original. It takes $T(\frac{n(n-1)}{n}) = T(n-1)$
 to solve one subproblem, so it takes $(n-1)T(n-1)$ to solve $n - 1$ of them. It then
 takes $\Theta(n)$ time to divide the problem into subproblems and insert the last item
 in the array into $A[1\ltwodots n-1]$, so we have
 \[
     T(n) = \begin{cases}
         \Theta(1) \quad &\text{if } n \leq 2 \\
         (n-1)T(n-1) + \Theta(1) \quad &\text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}.
 \]
