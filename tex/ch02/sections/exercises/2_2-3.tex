% Exercise 2.2-3

Assuming the element being searched for is equally likely to be at
any position in
the array, we would on average search through
\[
  \frac{1 + 2 + \cdots + n}{n}  = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^nk = \frac{n + 1}{2}
\]
elements for an input sequence of length $n$. In the worse case we
would search through
all $n$ elements.

Thus the average- and worst-case running times are $\Theta(n)$, since
\[
  \frac{n + 1}{2} = \frac{n}{2} + \frac{1}{2},
\]
and the dominant term is $\frac{1}{2}n$, which is equivalent to
$\Theta(n)$. Obviously,
looping through $n$ items sequentially is $\Theta(n)$, so the
average- and worse-case
running times are in an equivalent $\Theta$-class.
