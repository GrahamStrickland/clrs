% Problem 2-1

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{a.}]
        \begin{proof}
            Since \textsc{Insertion-Sort} has a running time of $\Theta(n^2)$,
            due to the nested \textbf{while} loop of lines 5-7 (p. 26), and the
            loop of lines 1-7, if we are instead sorting $n$ items divided into
            $n/k$ sublists, the outer \textbf{for} loop will run $k$ times for
            each sublist. Since each sublist will contain $k$ items, the \textbf{while} 
            loop will run $k - 1$ times for each sublist, so we have a running time
            of $\Theta(k^2)$ for each sublist, and since there are $n/k$ sublists, 
            the total running time will be
            \[
                \Theta\biggl(\frac{n}{k}\cdot k^2\biggr) = \Theta(nk).
            \]
        \end{proof}
    \item[\textbf{b.}] If we merge the sublists when their length reaches $k$, we are
        removing $\lg{k}$ levels from the recursion tree on p. 38, so we have
        \[
            \lg{n} - \lg{k} = \lg{n/k}
        \]
        levels on the tree. Now, from \textbf{a.}, we have the \textsc{Insertion-Sort}
        algorithm on the $n/k$ sublists with a running time of $\Theta(nk)$, so the
        new algorithm will have a running time of
        \[
            \Theta(n\lg{(n/k)} + nk) = \Theta(n[\lg{(n/k)} + k]) = \Theta(n\lg{(n/k)}).
        \]
    \item[\textbf{c.}] We are looking for the point at which 
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                \Theta(nk + n\lg{(n/k)}) &= \Theta(n\lg{n}) \\ 
                \Leftrightarrow c_1[nk + n\lg{(n/k)}] &= c_2n\lg{n} \\
                \Leftrightarrow c_2\lg{n} &= c_1[k - \lg{n/k}] \\
                \Leftrightarrow k + \lg{k} &= \frac{(c_1 + c_2)\lg{n}}{c_2}.
            \end{split}
        \end{equation*}
    \item[\textbf{d.}] In practice, we should choose $k$ to be $\ceil{\lg{n}}$, since 
        this will be the closest point to which 
        \[
            k + \lg{k} = \frac{(c_1 + c_2)\lg{n}}{c_2},
        \]
        where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{itemize}
