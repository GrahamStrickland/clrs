% Exercise 1.1-5

If we are tring to find the optimal layout of train routes so that trains do
not cross tracks at the same time, then only the best solution will do. On the
other hand, if we are trying to minimize the cost of procuring parts for the 
train, then an approximation to the best solution may be good enough.
