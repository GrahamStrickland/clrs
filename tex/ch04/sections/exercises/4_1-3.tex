% Exercise 4.1-3

% TODO: Replace this with Rust benchmarks

For an array of size $n = 20$, the divide-and-conquer algorithm overtakes the brute-force
algorithm, using a Java implementation of both algorithms. The hybrid approach using
brute-force for $n_0 < 20$ seems to run faster than the purely recursive approach for
all values of $n_0$.
