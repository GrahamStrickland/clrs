% Exercise 3.1-7

\begin{proof}
    Suppose we have some function $f \in \lbrace o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n)) \rbrace$.
    Then we have, for any $c_1, c_2 \in \mathbb{R}^+$, that there exists $n_0 > 0$
    such that $0 \leq f(n) < c_2 g(n)$ and $0 \leq c_1 g(n) < f(n)$ for all 
    $n \geq n_0$.
    
    But now we have 
    \[
        \lim_{n \to \infty}{\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}} = 0
    \]
    and
    \[
        \lim_{n \to \infty}{\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}} = \infty,
    \]
    so that we have a contradiction. Thus, we conclude that such an $f$ does not exist, 
    and $o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n)) = \varnothing$, the empty set.
\end{proof}
