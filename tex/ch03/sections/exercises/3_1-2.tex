% Exercise 3.1-2

\begin{proof}
    By the binomial expansion, we have
    \[
        {(n + a)}^b = \sum_{k=0}^b \binom{b}{k} n^k a^{b - k},
    \]
    and since $b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b > 0$, it follows that $0 \leq k \leq b$ for
    all terms in the expansion, so that the highest-order term is
    \[
        n^ba^{b - b} = n^b a^0 = n^b.
    \]
    Thus ${(n + a)}^b = \Theta(n^b)$.
\end{proof}
