Linked lists have the following strengths:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They are easy to insert items into.
    \item They are easy to remove items from.
    \item They do not require a large block of contiguous memore to be allocated
    ahead of insertion.
\end{itemize}
They have the following limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Traversing the linked list is slow.
    \item Accessing an element is not easy and requires indirect methods.
    \item Deallocating the memory used is slow.
\end{itemize}
